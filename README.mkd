# issuu2pdf #
Reading documents on issuu.com is really painful, so this tool downloads the
issuu document and converts it to a pdf.
The fonts can be a bit fuzzy, but it's still better than using the issuu
reader.

## Requirements ##
* python3
* imagemagick

## Usage ##
Run issuu2pdf.py with the url and output file name as arguments

    ./issuu2pdf.py url output-file
